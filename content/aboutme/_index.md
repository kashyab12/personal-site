Title: About Me
type: aboutme

Welcome to my digital sandbox! I'm super passionate about technology and love to build things that interest me and bring value to others. Currently I work as a founding engineer at [Hockeystack (YC S23)](https://hockeystack.com/). I've spent a great deal of time tinkering with software, hardware, and music, and am always excited to talk to people passionate about realizing their ideas. I am best reachable via [email](mailto:iamkashyab@gmail.com).
