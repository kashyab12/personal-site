Welcome to my digital sandbox! I'm super passionate about technology and love to build things that interest me and bring value to others. Currently I work as a software engineer at TikTok and spend most nights building on different ideas. I've spent a great deal of time tinkering with software, hardware, and music. I'm always excited to talk to people passionate about realizing their ideas and am best reachable via [email](mailto:iamkashyab@gmail.com).
